# Secure Code Execution Engine

A secure, multi-language code execution engine powered by Docker and Firecracker microVMs.

## Overview

This project provides a secure sandboxed environment for executing user-submitted code across multiple programming languages. It starts with Docker-based isolation and evolves into a Firecracker-powered microVM solution for enhanced security and performance.

## Features

- 🔒 **Secure Sandboxing** - Isolated execution environments with strict resource limits
- 🐳 **Docker Integration** - Initial implementation using Docker containers
- ⚡ **Firecracker MicroVMs** - High-performance virtualization with minimal overhead
- 🌐 **Multi-Language Support** - Python, Node.js, Bash, and Go
- 📊 **Observability** - Metrics, logging, and monitoring
- 🚀 **Production Ready** - Kubernetes deployment with autoscaling

## Project Status

🚧 **In Development** - Currently in Sprint 1

## Roadmap

This project follows an 8-sprint development plan:

- **Sprint 1**: Docker MVP
- **Sprint 2**: Hardened Docker Sandbox
- **Sprint 3**: Firecracker Foundation
- **Sprint 4**: Firecracker Integration v1
- **Sprint 5**: Performance + VM Pooling
